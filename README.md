## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set up environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` and fill in:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```
> ⚠️ Never share your `.env` file or post API keys publicly.

#### Optional: backup AI provider (failover)
If OpenAI runs out of quota or gets rate-limited (HTTP 429 / `insufficient_quota`),
the bot can automatically fail over to a second, **OpenAI-compatible** AI provider
so it keeps answering instead of going dark. Works with Groq, OpenRouter, DeepSeek,
Together, a second OpenAI key, a local Ollama, etc. Leave these unset to disable
failover — the bot then shows a clean "AI temporarily unavailable" notice instead
of a raw error.
```
FALLBACK_API_KEY=your_backup_provider_key
FALLBACK_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1   # the provider's OpenAI-compatible endpoint
FALLBACK_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile             # model for normal replies (optional; this is the default)
FALLBACK_MINI_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile        # model for the cheap classifier (optional; defaults to FALLBACK_MODEL)
```
> Groq has a free tier and an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so it's the easiest drop-in backup.

### 3. Enable Discord Bot Intents
In the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications):
- Go to your app → **Bot**
- Enable **Message Content Intent** under Privileged Gateway Intents
- Save changes

### 4. Invite the bot to your server
In the portal → **OAuth2 → URL Generator**:
- Scopes: `bot`
- Permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `View Channels`, `Read Messages`

### 5. Run the bot
```bash
python bot.py
```

## Updating the Bot's Knowledge

### Option A — Re-scrape the website
Run this whenever your website content changes:
```bash
python scrape_site.py
```
This automatically updates `knowledge_base.txt`. No bot restart needed.

### Option B — Upload a document
Add a PDF or TXT file to the bot's knowledge:
```bash
python upload_docs.py path/to/your/document.pdf
python upload_docs.py path/to/your/document.txt
```

List current documents:
```bash
python upload_docs.py
```

Remove a document:
```bash
python upload_docs.py --remove filename.txt
```

All uploaded files are stored in the `knowledge/` folder.  
The bot reads this folder live — **no restart required**.
